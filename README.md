To create your own boxes, make the project available online by going to: https://frontend-clone-dropbox.herokuapp.com

Just check and access the application.

Ps: If a box has already been created with the name you want, it will show all the files that have been added to this box and you can also load more into the box in real time. Otherwise, an empty box will be created.

Remembering that all the code produced was through the 6th edition of the WeekOmnistack, held by Rocketseat. It's a week of immersion in NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native technologies, as well as the ecosystem that surrounds them.
